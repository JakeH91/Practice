      <h1>My Journey</h1>
      <p>Over the past few years I have been winding my way through the incredible plethora of education resources available online. It has taken me to areas of knowledge I had not considered, and the list of resources I am using increases almost every day.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, I thought I would use my growing knowledge in coding to provide an area in which I can bring everything together.</p>

    <h3>My Goal</h3>
    <p>Right now I am only at the beginning of my programming adventure, within a year I would like to be able to think that I might be not terrible at coding. It could be a big ask.</p>
