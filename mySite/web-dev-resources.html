        <h1>My Journey</h1>
        <p>Over the past few years I have been winding my way through the incredible plethora of education resources available online. It has taken me to areas of knowledge I had not considered, and the list of resources I am using increases almost every day.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, I thought I would use my growing knowledge in coding to provide an area in which I can bring everything together.</p>
