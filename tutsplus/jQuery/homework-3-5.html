    <p>Isn't this lovely bit of animation just amazing? And to think, only perhaps 2 weeks ago I didn't even know that such a thing as jQuery existed. OK I say 2 weeks, I just checked. It's actually closer to a month and in fact a little over, but it is still a relatively new concept to me. And I deviated for a while into the wonders of Bootstrap (as demonstrated most admirably by the magnificent button that you see above), so I have only worked with jQuery for a short amount of time. I admit, I am actually writing this before I have even started the animation, so I'm not quite sure how hard I'm going to find it, but I can be sure of one thing: Nobody will see this until it IS completed, so as far as they're concerned, this was an display of just how easy I find jQuery, in all it's splender. Yes, the animate() function is something I hope to play with a lot, as I'm sure knowing it will allow me to create a lot of interesting applications on any websites I take part in in the future. OK, I think this is enough text for me to practice on. TO THE JAVASCRIPT!</p>
